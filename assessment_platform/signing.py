"""HMAC body-signing for the platform <-> agent link.

Signs the *exact* request-body bytes with HMAC-SHA256 under a shared secret that
is **never transmitted** (unlike the bearer token, which rides in a header in the
clear and so cannot double as the key). A valid signature proves the sender holds
the secret and that the body wasn't altered in flight. A timestamp is folded into
the signed message and checked against a tolerance window, so a captured request
can't be replayed indefinitely.

Header format (Stripe-style): `X-Assess-Signature: t=<unix>,v1=<hex-hmac-sha256>`
Signed message:                `f"{t}.".encode() + body`

This module is mirrored **verbatim** in the agent repo — the two sides must agree
byte for byte, so keep them identical.
